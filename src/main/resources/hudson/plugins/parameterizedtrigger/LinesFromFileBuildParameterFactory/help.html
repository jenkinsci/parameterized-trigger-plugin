  This ParameterFactory creates parameters from each line in a text file. For each line
  in the file, the Parameters section is evaluated replacing $LINE with the value.
  <p />
  For each unique line in the file a build of the project(s) is triggered. If the file
  is empty, no builds will be triggered.
  <p />
  This can be used to create a dynamic axis of parameters to invoke a worker job
  multiple times, where the parameter values are not known at configuration time.
