  When activating this option, triggered builds will be run synchronously. The
  result of the current build step or the current build can then be controlled
  using the three following options:<br/><ul>
  <li><b>Fail this build step if the triggered build is worse or equal to</b>:
  This option takes precedence over the two following ones if its value is not
  <b>never</b>. In that case, the result of the current build step (that is,
  success or failure) is based on the result of the triggered builds. If the
  condition defined for at least one of the triggered build is met, then the
  build step will be considered as failed.</li>
  <li><b>Mark this build as failure if the triggered build is worse or equal to</b>:
  This option takes precedence over the next one if its value is not set to
  <b>never</b>. In that case, the current build will be considered as failed
  based on the result of the triggered builds and the value of the option.</li>
  <li><b>Mark this build as unstable if the triggered build is worse or equal to</b>:
  This option is taken into account if its value is not <b>never</b>. In that
  case, the build will be considered as unstable based on the result of the
  triggered builds and the value of this option.</li>
  </ul>
