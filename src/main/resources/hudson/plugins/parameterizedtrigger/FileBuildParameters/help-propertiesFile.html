<div>
  Comma seperated list of paths to file(s) in the workspace that contains the parameters for the new project.
  The file should have KEY=value pairs, one per line (Java properties file format).
  Backslashes are used for escaping, so use "\\" for a single backslash.
  <p/>
  Current build paramenters and/or environment variables can be used in form:
  <tt>${PARAM}</tt> or <tt>$PARAM</tt>.
