<p>Determines for which results of the current build, the new build(s) will be triggered.</p>
<p>
The <b>Explicit</b> option is used for conditionally triggering downstream jobs.<br>
There are two ways to select downstream jobs to trigger:
<ul>
  <li>through a build variable with the same name as the triggered downstream job (value must be <i>true</i>).</li>
  <li>through the <i>TRIGGER_JOB_NAMES</i> environment variable (contains comma separated downstream job names).</li>
</ul>
