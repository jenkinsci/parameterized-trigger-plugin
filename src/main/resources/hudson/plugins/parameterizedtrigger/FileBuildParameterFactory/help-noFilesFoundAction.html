This option determines the behaviour to take if the from,to and step values do not form a valid combination. One that gives a finite number of combinations.<br/>
The actions that can be taken are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Don't trigger these projects</b> This will cause the projects not to be triggered at all for this configuration. (This is the default, and occured in older versions)</li>
    <li><b>Skip these parameters</b> This will allow the projects to be triggered without these parameters.</li>
    <li><b>Fail the build step</b> This will fail the buildstep with an RuntimeException.</li>
  </ul>
