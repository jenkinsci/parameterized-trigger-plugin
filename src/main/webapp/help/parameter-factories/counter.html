  This ParameterFactory generates a sequence of numbers as parameters. More precisely,
  for each number from <tt>From</tt> to <tt>To</tt> with step size <tt>Step</tt>
  the Parameters section is evaluated replacing $COUNT with the current number.

  For each different number a build of the project(s) is triggered. If the sequence is
  empty no builds will be triggered.
